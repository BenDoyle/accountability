NOTES AND TODO

* Fix up roles <=> parties accoication, currently makes no sense (can have multiple roles over time within a party). 
Maybe just need to have a seperate party_membership entry per role? Then we need logic to resolve which role to use 
(think leader/member...)

* Write scraper for Ontario Legislative Assembly data

* Add Person <=> Vote    <=> Debate

* Write scraper for Hansard data

* Write scraper for news sources

* Eventually, I'll need moderation.
There should be a mechanism to look though stories and make claims about them, i.e. story X says candidate Y supports issue Z.
Claims should go into a queue, with a pool of moderators able to pick from the queue.
Once N moderators have verified the claim, a connection is created, and browsable, (or if M reject the cliam, N/M).
If a regular user finds fault with the claim (reports abuse or suchlike), it is removed from the main site immediately, and returned to the moderation queue, where N is increased.
Should I revoke moderation status if a claim you've supported has been overturned? Maybe if your record is poor.
Should ensure that the same group of people do not moderate each other more than necessary
To this end, build a social graph where connections are common moderations. Limit the cliquiness, and strength of individual links.
Maybe let users select M,N, or their ratio?
